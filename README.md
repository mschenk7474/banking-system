# Banking System
Within this banking system constructed using C++, you are able to display account information, add a deposit to an account, withdraw from an account, add a new account to the system, find an account by using the ID the system gives you, remove an account, show the total balance for all accounts in the system, add a dividend to all accounts, add contact information to an account, and quit out of the system whenever you want.

This program utilizes two classes, one for handling the bank accounts, and the other for the contact information. These two classes work simultaneously to achieve this working bank system that can be used right now!

Go ahead and download this system, and store your bank information today!


## Getting Started
---
You are going to want to use your IDE of choice that can run C++ programs and pull the folder from this repo. After that, you are able to open main and press the play button in the one of the top corners, and it should run the bank system and allow you to do all that entails.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
bankingSystem           (project root folder)
+-- bankAccount.cpp     (holds all of the bankAcount class' functions and what they do)
+-- bankAccount.hpp     (declares all of the bankAccount class' functions, determining if they are private or public)            
+-- contact.cpp         (holds all of the contact class' functions and what they do)
+-- contact.hpp         (declares all of the contact class' functions, determining if they are private or public)
+-- main.cpp            (holds the menu for the banking system, and has the necesary functions calls and logic)
README.md               (general information about project)
```

## Required Technologies
---
* An IDE that can run C++ programs (I program on a Mac so I use XCode, but another viable option can be Eclipse)
* Just the base C++ framework to run C++ programs
