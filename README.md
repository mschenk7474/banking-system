+-- bankAccount.cpp     (holds all of the bankAcount class' functions and what they do)
+-- bankAccount.hpp     (declares all of the bankAccount class' functions, determining if they are private or public)            
+-- contact.cpp         (holds all of the contact class' functions and what they do)
+-- contact.hpp         (declares all of the contact class' functions, determining if they are private or public)

## Required Technologies
---
* An IDE that can run C++ programs (I program on a Mac so I use XCode, but some another viable option can be Eclipse)
* Just the base C++ framework to run C++ programs
